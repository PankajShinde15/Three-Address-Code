Three address code is a type of intermediate code which is easy to generate and can be easily converted to machine code.It makes use of at most three addresses and one operator to represent an expression and the value computed at each instruction is stored in temporary variable generated by compiler. The compiler decides the order of operation given by three address code.

General representation â€“      
            a = b op c
Where a, b or c represents operands like names, constants or compiler generated temporaries and op represents the operator
